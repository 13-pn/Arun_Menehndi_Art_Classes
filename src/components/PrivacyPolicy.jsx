        </p>
        <p>
          We have adopted this Privacy Policy, which determines how we are
          processing the information collected by{" "}
          <strong>www.arunmehndiart.com</strong>, which also provides the
          reasons why we must collect certain personal data about you.
          Therefore, you must read this Privacy Policy before using{" "}
          <strong>www.arunmehndiart.com</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We take care of your personal data and undertake to guarantee its
          confidentiality and security.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          When you visit the website, we automatically collect certain
          information about your device, including your web browser, IP address,
          time zone, and some installed cookies. Additionally, as you browse, we
          collect information about the pages or products you view, the websites
          or search terms that referred you, and how you interact with the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          We refer to this automatically-collected information as{" "}
          <strong>“Device Information.”</strong> Moreover, we might collect the
          personal data you provide to us (such as Name, Address, or Payment
          Information) during registration to fulfill agreements or orders.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Do We Process Your Data?</h2>
        <p>
          Our top priority is customer data security. We process only minimal
          user data — just enough to maintain the website effectively.
          Automatically collected information helps identify potential abuse and
          improve user experience. This statistical data never personally
          identifies any specific user.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can browse the website without sharing personal details. However,
          to use certain features (like newsletter signup or contact forms),
          you’ll need to provide personal information such as your email, name,
          or city. You may choose not to provide data, but that might limit some
          functionalities.
        </p>
        <p>
